There's several ways in which an <b>invite</b> can be shared:<br><br><b>Scheduled appointments:</b> If booking a fixed-time consultation, your client will be sent an email/SMS confirmation at the point of booking creation. Once booked, you can also resend the invite or a reminder by finding the appointment on the "Scheduled" tab and selecting the "Invite" icon.<br><b>Waiting rooms:</b> To share the re-usable link to your waiting room, select the "Invite" icon on the desired room. You can choose to send an SMS or email invite in-platform with up to a 200 character message, or alternatively copy the link and attach it in your other communication or to your website.<br><b>Live call invite:</b> To invite a 3rd party directly into a specific live consultation, select the "Share" icon in the top right of the call window. From here you can send an invite via SMS or email, or choose to share the link directly.<br><br>If you are still having technical difficulties with service invites, please contact our Customer Support team at <b><a href="mailto:customer.support@involve.vc">customer.support@involve.vc</a></b>."
